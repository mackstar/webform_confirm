About the Webform Confirm Project
================================

Webform is a popular way to have user submit inquiries through your website. By default this doesn't contain the ability to review your content by way of a confirmation screen before committing to your submission. This project allows you to have a confirmation page enabled.

The project is currently available as a sandbox project on [drupal.org](http://drupal.org "drupal") at [this location](http://drupal.org/sandbox/mackstar/1075540 "Webform Confirm sandbox project"). 

Issues
------

The project is working with a standard install of Webform. Changing the theme elements for forms is not currently supported. 

Future improvements and features
------------------------------

At the moment the form uses xml parsing to make changes to the form because of form_api's sometimes lack of ease of use. A form api solution is planned for later versions as is support for Drupal 7. 

The current version is automatically on for all Webform forms when enabled. In the future this will be set per form as needed.
